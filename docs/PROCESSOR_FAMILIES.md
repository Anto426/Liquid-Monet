# Processor family policy

`LiquidGlassProcessorFamilies` is an offline, manually maintained table of processor generations
and series. It is not a list of phones or an authoritative ranking of every SoC. Its quality
ceilings are SDK policy choices which still need representative-device measurements.

The Android hardware probe resolves the explicit SoC model first, then the hardware identifier,
on IO. Case and punctuation are normalized; bounded identifier matching never runs in drawing.
Specific generation aliases precede generic series rules. Vendor-only identifiers such as `qcom`
and unknown identifiers return no family, leaving the existing measured classification in charge.

Each family contains a stable ID, display name, CPU budget ceiling and optional introduction year
of the underlying generation. A rebrand keeps the original generation's year. The final CPU
ceiling is the minimum of the manual limit, generation era, CPU/memory-copy timings, core/clock
limits, RAM/heap limits and available graphics APIs. GPU rendering then selects a budget within
that ceiling. A large RAM allocation cannot compensate for a weak CPU, nor can a flagship name
compensate for failed or slow measurements.

Generation eras use fixed policy boundaries: generations introduced through 2016 are capped at
BALANCED, 2017–2020 at HIGH; later or unknown dates add no extra age ceiling. These are conservative
SDK defaults, not manufacturer performance claims. No current-year arithmetic or age inferred
from the phone, Android release, firmware or build timestamp is used. Unknown dates stay null.

The table currently covers Apple A8–A19 and M1–M5, Qualcomm Snapdragon, MediaTek Dimensity/Helio,
Samsung Exynos, Google Tensor, UNISOC and Kirin families. Coverage and dated generations are deliberately partial.
For example, unspecified Snapdragon 8 generations use a conservative series fallback rather than
inheriting the year of the first 8-series chip. Unverified MediaTek/Samsung board-code aliases are
not inferred from a vendor prefix. Add a specific generation before its series fallback, document
its source here and test both the commercial name and available board codes.

Saved profiles retain their existing version and hardware key. Table changes affect only a new
calibration, not an already persisted result. Family metadata is available through
`LocalLiquidGlassPerformance.current.device.processorFamily`. Optical fidelity and the explicit
LiquidCard treatment are separate from the classification table.

On iOS the Metal device name supplies the SoC model. `Apple A18 Pro GPU`, for example, resolves to
the A18 generation while preserving the exact model in `device.socModel`. A-series X/Z variants and
M-series Pro/Max/Ultra variants retain the underlying generation's date. iPhone identifiers and
generic `Apple GPU` strings are not CPU models and do not select a family. Future unknown chips
still use the native benchmark and hardware ceilings. Existing fixed era rules apply equally:
A10 generation is at most BALANCED; A11–A14 and M1 at most HIGH; later generations may reach ULTRA
when RAM, measured CPU/memory traffic and real rendering also qualify. These thresholds need
representative-device validation and do not guarantee that one chip is faster than another.
